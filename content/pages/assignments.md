Cases
-----

Each group will be required to hand in three case write-ups. All teams must do Colonial Homes since this is a case which requires price elasticity analysis. You may then choose anyÂ **two** of the following four cases:

Virgin Mobile  
Keurig  
EA Sims  
Cigarette Wars

The reports should be 2 pages long. This space constraint is designed to ensure that you think hard about the most important points to write down.

Your reports must be handed in at the start of the class in which the case will be discussed. These cases will be graded and will determine 36% of your overall grade. For the three written cases you should discuss the cases only within your group.

Use the case questions to guide your reports (and to help prepare for our discussion of the other cases). Some additional recommendations:

1.  Separately answer each discussion question.
2.  Do not omit the obvious, but omit needless words.
3.  Use numerical analysis wherever possible. Describe the steps you took to reach your numerical conclusions.
